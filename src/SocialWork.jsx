            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and prolonged nationwide lockdown has posed an unprecedented challenge for education institutions. In the face of the resultant chaos and uncertainty, education leaders have been braving all odds to ensure provision of uninterrupted learning. Viewing this crisis as an opportunity, school managements are introducing innovative online teaching-learning solutions and engagement programmes while preparing students and faculty for the digital online world.</p>
            <p>With a well established network of 12 K-12 schools, 5 preschools and 2 business schools in north India, Seth Anandram Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions (SAJGEI) has been at the forefront of this digital technologies-driven online education revolution</p>
            <p>Under the able leadership of chairman Shishir Jaipuria, the SAJGEI management and staff have designed an engaging and personalised online curriculum and ensured a smooth transition of the teaching-learning process to online digital platforms. </p>
            <p>“Our endeavor is to transform adversity into opportunity by addressing the challenges with commitment and dedication and prepare our students and staff for the future. We are progressively moving towards evolving a new paradigm of learning by focusing on innovative methods like flipped classrooms and blended learning. We are upbeat that the disruption caused by the pandemic will usher a new change in the socio-economic scenario of our country,” says Jaipuria, grandson of Late Seth Mungturam Jaipuria (1904-1978) who promoted the group’s flagship Seth Anandram Jaipuria College in Kolkata in 1945.</p>
            <p>A graduate of Christ Church College, Kanpur, with a law degree from the city’s DAV Law College, Shishir Jaipuria joined the family business as an executive officer of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills. During a 36-year eventful career, he has held several important positions in family companies. Since he took charge as chairman of SAJGEI in 2010, the group has rapidly expanded, particularly in the educationally under-served Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh. The group’s flagship Seth Anandram Jaipuria School, Kanpur (estb.1974) is ranked #1 in the city and #2 in Uttar Pradesh in the EducationWorld India School Rankings 2019-20.</p>
